My learning on internal working of bitcoin

- Private Key is an arbitrary 32-bytes (256-bit) number. Typically it is encoded as base-58 WIF format.
- Hashed Public Key is the Bitcoin Address which you can freely share.
- To spend the money, you would need to present the Public Key and Signature for that BTC address.

As a fun fact, I can generate my own BTC address: 1KeVN9yzZVqGRhB7MYWb2AdUQdjrDBjNQM
